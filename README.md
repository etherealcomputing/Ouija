**Ouija** is an open-source project purposed to create a holistic view into one's personal neurophysiology (starting with my own) using a range of personal data. Why? Because it's cool, current understanding of the brain feels far too abstract, and neuroscience / neurology is one of the most gatekept fields of health + wellness and I intend to do my small yet integral part to turn that on it's fucking head.

Additionally, while...others...may feel whacking healthcare CEOs is the path to providence, I am taking an inverse approach. My ultimate success metric for this project is that it makes getting access to your neural data so popular, Big Pharma tries to off me. (Which shouldn't be too hard since I've worked for all of the major ones)

"COME UNALIVE ME BRO" * Would go nicely on a crewneck honestly.

## What It Is

*   **Data-Driven:** This app uses real neurological + physiological data collected from my own person.
*   **Open-Source:** I believe in radical transparency and democratized knowledge, especially when that knowledge is attained through strife. The biggest power move IMO is to gain high-value knowledge to navigate tumult and then just give it away for free. No app subscriptions. No paid tiers. No courses. That's why the code, methodologies and (eventually) refined protocol will remain free and open for everyone to use and extrapolate upon, in perpetuity, throughout the universe, forever.
*   **Raw Potential:** This project is in its early stages. Don't expect a polished app. Expect something that smells vaguely of a lab, might crash, but has the potential to be revolutionary.

## What It's Not 

*   **A Finished Product:** This is going to be highly experimental software. Expect bugs, incomplete visualizations, and the occasional hallucinations. Additionally, always keep in mind that I seldom know what I'm doing. And while this isn't actually brain surgery, but it's technically adjacent to it, so it's one hell of a domain to try to teach yourself.
*   **A Scientific / Health Instrument:** This is an exploratory tool + personal project. Don't expect it to be FDA approved or anything like that, or productized. I already tried to do a Seed Round with this as black dream ai's flagship. Got into the top 10% of YC's Summer 2023 submissions batch first try, as well as a meeting with Founders Fund, but since this isn't a truly gamechanging like GenAI for wedding vows, they ultimately told me to get fucked. No ARR, no quid. 
*   **For the Faint of Heart:** This project leverages my own personal medical + physiological information. Neuroscience suffers from a lack of available data due to HIPAA and general privacy concerns. So here come's the degree-less, college dropout with a 2006 haircut to save the day. I'm open-sourcing everything. BlackRock and whoever hacked 23&Me already have my DNA anyway. Just burning the midnight oil before the killer bio-drones are unleashed.

## Core Data Sources:

*   **Neuroimaging:** SPECT (rested & active state), structural MRIs, and guided rested-state fMRI
*   **Neurophysiological Biopotentials:** Neurosity Crown BCI (EEG), Upside Down Labs (EEG/EOG/ECG/EMG)
*   **Physiological Metrics:** Oura Ring 2 (sleep, HRV, etc.) + Withings Full Body Smart Scale (vascular age, body composition, ECG, weight)
*   **Neurological/GP Medical Reports:** The opinions of experts (for better or worse)
*   **In-Progress:** Currently working on attaining MEG + DTI scans

## Tech Stack (MVP)

*   **Frontend:** Replit (initial), React.js, basic HTML/CSS/JS, D3.js.
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLite, Pandas
*   **Models:** OpenAI GPT-4, Meta Llama + SAMed2
*   **Deployment:** Replit, Vercel, Railway

## Contributing

*   If you're into brains, code, and radical openness then contributions are more than welcome.
*   This project is intended to be a public good and is open for collaboration.
*   I am especially looking for help with seasoned neuroscience expertise especially in brain emulation and BCIs + advanced data visualization, data analysis, AI/ML and full-stack dev. 

## Roadmap

*   **GPT Interface:** Because God-forbid we didn't have that, right? [Check out the PoC Demo!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioDNKShuZ-U&t=4s)
*   **MVP Brain Visualization:** A functional application to display all of the data. 
*   **Data Analysis Pipelines:**  Automated tools for data processing.
*   **Predictive Capabilities:** Building + utilizing ML models to forecast states and behavior.
*   **Community:** Creating a group around this project to foster more experimentation. 
*   **Integration:** Open APIs for other data tools.
*   **Decentralization** Using decentralized tools for storage, privacy and security.

## Contribute 

1.  Fork the repo
2.  Add your own data, analysis, features, or visualizations
3.  Open a PR and lets talk.

Ouija is more than just code; it's an exploration of the self and a means to gain granular insight into the organ that literally enables us to percieve our own existence, among many other functions. We have access to real-time analytics for virtually every other facet of our anatomy except for the single most important one. That needs to change. 

## Let's hack my brain together.
