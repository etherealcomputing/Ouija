## What It Is

*   **Data-Driven:** This app uses real neurological + physiological data collected from personal neuroimaging and biometric sources.
*   **Open-Source & Open-Science:** We believe in radical transparency and democratized knowledge. The code, methodologies, and refined protocols will remain free and open for everyone to use and extrapolate upon, in perpetuity.
*   **Advanced Processing:** Implementing sophisticated pipelines for neuroimaging data analysis, including Statistical Shape Analysis of brain structures using methods like SPHARM-PDM, and exploring Local Shape Descriptors for enhanced segmentation and feature extraction.
*   **Raw Potential:** This project is in its early stages. While backed by ethereal computing, Inc., it remains experimental software with the potential to revolutionize personal neurophysiological understanding.

## What It's Not 

*   **A Finished Product:** This is experimental software. Expect bugs, incomplete visualizations, and ongoing development. While we're building on solid foundations, we're pushing boundaries in neurotechnology and data processing.
*   **A Scientific / Health Instrument:** This is an exploratory tool and research project. It's not FDA approved or intended for medical use. It represents our commitment to open science and technological innovation in neurophysiology.
*   **For the Faint of Heart:** This project leverages personal medical + physiological information to advance our understanding of neurophysiology. We're committed to transparency while maintaining appropriate privacy standards.

## Core Data Sources:

*   **Neuroimaging:** 
    * SPECT (rested & active state)
    * Structural MRIs with advanced shape analysis capabilities
    * Guided rested-state fMRI
*   **Neurophysiological Biopotentials:** Neurosity Crown BCI (EEG), Upside Down Labs (EEG/EOG/ECG/EMG)
*   **Physiological Metrics:** Withings Full Body Smart Scale (vascular age, body composition, ECG, weight)
*   **Neurological/GP Medical Reports:** Expert insights and analysis
*   **In-Progress:** MEG + DTI scans integration

## Processing & Analysis

*   **Structural MRI Processing:**
    * Statistical Shape Analysis using SPHARM-PDM for quantitative brain structure analysis
    * Exploration of Local Shape Descriptors for enhanced segmentation and feature extraction
    * Robust pipeline development for consistent, high-quality results
*   **Data Management:**
    * Processing code available in the repository
    * Large derived datasets stored externally with documented access
    * Smaller datasets maintained internally for quick reference

## Stack (MVP)

*   **Frontend:** Replit (initial), React.js, basic HTML/CSS/JS, D3.js.
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLite, Pandas
*   **Models:** OpenAI API Platform + SAMed2
*   **Deployment:** Vercel (for MVP)

## Contributing

*   If you're into brains, code, and radical openness then contributions are more than welcome.
*   This project is intended to be a public good and is open for collaboration.
*   We are especially looking for help with:
    * Neuroscience expertise (brain emulation and BCIs)
    * Advanced data visualization
    * Data analysis and processing
    * AI/ML implementation
    * Full-stack development

## Roadmap

*   **GPT Interface:** Enhanced natural language interaction with neurophysiological data
*   **MVP Brain Visualization:** Comprehensive data display and analysis platform
*   **Data Analysis Pipelines:** 
    * Automated tools for data processing
    * Advanced structural MRI analysis
    * Shape analysis implementation
*   **Predictive Capabilities:** ML models for state and behavior forecasting
*   **Community:** Building a collaborative ecosystem for neurophysiological research
*   **Integration:** Open APIs for data tools and analysis
*   **Decentralization:** Secure, private data storage and processing

## Contribute 

1.  Fork the repo
2.  Add your own data, analysis, features, or visualizations
3.  Open a PR and let's talk.

Ouija represents a step forward in making neurophysiological understanding more accessible and actionable. By combining personal data, open science, and advanced processing capabilities, we're working to provide deeper insights into the organ that enables our perception of existence.
